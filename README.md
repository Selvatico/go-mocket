# Go-Mocket â€“ Go GORM & SQL mocking library

Go-Mocket is a library inspired by [DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock).

As an inspiration library, it is the implementation of [sql/driver](https://godoc.org/database/sql/driver) interface but at the same time it follows a different approach and only has a similar API.
This library helps to mock any DB connection with [jinzhu/gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm), as it was the created to serve this purpose.

List of features in the library:

* Mock `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, `DELETE`
* Support for transactions
* 2 API's to use - `chaining` and via specifying a whole mock object
* Matching by prepared statements arguments
* You don't require to change anything inside your code to start using this library
* Ability to trigger exceptions
* Attach callbacks to mocked responses to add an additional check or modify a response

**NOTE**, Please be aware that driver catches SQL without DB specifics. Generation of queries is done by *SQL* package

## Install

```
go get github.com/Selvatico/go-mocket
```

## Usage

There are two possible ways to use `mocket`:

* Chaining API
* Specifying `FakeResponse` object with all fields manually. Could be useful for cases when mocks stored separately as the list of FakeResponses. 

### Enabling driver

Somewhere in your code, do this to set up a tests

```go
import (
    "database/sql"
    mocket "github.com/Selvatico/go-mocket"
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
)

func SetupTests() {
    mocket.Catcher.Register()
    // GORM
    db, err := gorm.Open(mocket.DriverName, "any_string") // Could be any connection string
    app.DB = db // Assumption that it will be used everywhere the same
    //OR 
    // Regular sql package usage
    db, err := sql.Open(mocket.DriverName, "any_string")
}
```

Now, if you use a singleton instance of DB, it will use a mocked connection everywhere.

### Chain usage

#### Example of mocking by pattern

```go
import mocket "github.com/Selvatico/go-mocket"
import "net/http/httptest"

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
    request := httptest.NewRequest("POST", "/application", nil)
    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()

    GlobalMock := mocket.Catcher
    GlobalMock.Logging = true // log mocket behavior

    // field names here mapped to the database schema
    commonReply := []map[string]interface{}{{"some_id": "2", "field": "value"}}
    // Mock only by query pattern
    GlobalMock.NewMock().WithQuery(`"campaigns".name IS NULL AND (("uuid" = test_uuid))`).WithReply(commonReply)
    Post(recorder, request) // call handler

    r := recorder.Result()
    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)

    // some assertion about results
    //...
}

```
